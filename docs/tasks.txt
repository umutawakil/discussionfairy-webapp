-Abitrary errors on the callback of a request or response can split the main thread.
Only safeguard against this is to put your callbacks in a try catch block. This means although there is a route
utility each service method must take responsibility for handling async errors. Could add this to the list
of test criteria for each service method and route.

Is all this worth it in terms of testability? Have to make the utility service return values just so it can be tested.

-The individual elements of the discussion list on mobile need to be tested for long values (such as really long reference links)

-More tests for the validation logic for browseService, possibly a utility class with the various potential inputs
and error cases. This gets me thinking we could test the logic inside the routes independently of the routes reducing
the need to hit the actual service. Might be a place to add functional P to algorithmic code

-CloudFront distribution (CDN) in CloudFormation for the audio bucket: Separate stack
-Separate stack for AWS user or build them into the application stack and feed them as parameters into the others.
-Set algorithm type explicitly for the JWT
-Integration tests for all new web  endpoints and also invoke their error states.

DynamoDB AutoScaling
How exactly is this suppose to be configured properly for CloudFormation

-Mobile Detection

Logging
A way to integrate logging and error handling into the normal flow is needed.
I will assume this is a middle ware issue.

IP Blacklisting
Does API gateway offer solutions for doing this? Would it be more meaningful for us to analyze cloud
trail for IP info?

Exit vs back
Since the mobile sequence goes pretty deep should their be an exit button in the event uploads are not working?

-MaxCDN
Max cdn is not caching our boostrap/css, etc. Its not returning 304s. This could be to get me to pay them for faster
load times. If it comes to that then CloudFront still seems cheaper.

-Submit not just to Android but to the Amazon app store since its just Android devices. That will allow fireTv and kindles
which expands the possibilities for those that don't have one device or another.
